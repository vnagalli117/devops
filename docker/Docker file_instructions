Docker File instruction details
===============================

FROM---> To specify the base image which can be pulled from a container registry( Docker hub, GCR, Quay, ECR, etc)

RUN----> Executes commands during the image build process.

ENV----> Sets environment variables inside the image. It will be available during build time as well as in a running container. 

If you want to set only build-time variables, use ARG instruction.

COPY---> Copies local files and directories to the image

EXPOSE-> Specifies the port to be exposed for the Docker container.

ADD----> It is a more feature-rich version of the COPY instruction. It also allows copying from the URL that is the source and tar file auto-extraction into the image. 
However, usage of COPY command is recommended over ADD. If you want to download remote files, use curl or get using RUN.

WORKDIR-> Sets the current working directory. You can reuse this instruction in a Dockerfile to set a different working directory. 
If you set WORKDIR, instructions like RUN, CMD, ADD, COPY, or ENTRYPOINT gets executed in that directory.

VOLUME-> It is used to create or mount the volume to the Docker container

USER---> Sets the user name and UID when running the container. You can use this instruction to set a non-root user of the container.

LABEL--> It is used to specify metadata information of Docker image

ARG----> Is used to set build-time variables with key and value. the ARG variables will not be available when the container is running. 
If you want to persist a variable on a running container, use ENV.

CMD----> It is used to execute a command in a running container. There can be only one CMD, if multiple CMD there then it only applies to the last one. 
It can be overridden from the Docker CLI.

ENTRYPOINT--> Specifies the commands that will execute when the Docker container starts. If you donâ€™t specify any ENTRYPOINT, it defaults to /bin/sh -c. 
You can also override ENTRYPOINT using the --entrypoint flag using CLI. Please refer CMD vs ENTRYPOINT for more information.
